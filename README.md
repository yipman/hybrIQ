# hybrIQ
HybrIQ implements a hybrid classical-quantum approach for training and inference of a large language model (LLM) like GPT-2. It combines PyTorch for classical computations with Qiskit for quantum computations, focusing on matrix operations that could potentially be accelerated on a quantum computer.

## Key Features

Hybrid Design: Integrates classical GPU-based processing with quantum simulation for specific operations.

 Quantum Components: Implements quantum algorithms for inner product estimation (attention mechanism) and matrix-vector multiplication (feed-forward layers).

 Simulation-Based: Runs on IBM’s quantum simulator via Qiskit, so no real quantum hardware is needed.

This project is an educational tool and research prototype, showcasing how quantum computing might enhance machine learning workflows, particularly for transformer architectures.

Quantum Simulator

The code uses Qiskit’s Aer simulator to emulate quantum circuits. You don’t need access to a physical quantum computer to run this project.


## Usage

Running a Forward Pass

The project includes a simplified transformer model with quantum-accelerated operations. Here’s how to run the forward pass with a dummy input:

Import the modules:

 python

import torch
from model import Model, forward_pass

 Initialize the model:

 python

model = Model(vocab_size=100, d_model=4, n_layers=2, d_ff=16)

 Create a dummy input:

 python


batch = torch.zeros(2, 3, dtype=torch.long)  # Batch size 2, sequence length 3

 Run the forward pass:

 python

logits = forward_pass(model, batch)
print(f"Logits shape: {logits.shape}")


Quantum Functions

quantum_inner_product(u, v): Estimates the inner product <u|v> using the Hadamard test. This is used in the attention mechanism.

 quantum_matrix_vector_mult(W, x): Performs matrix-vector multiplication W @ x with a quantum circuit. This is used in feed-forward layers.

These functions run on Qiskit’s qasm_simulator and are designed for small-scale demonstration.

## Additional Notes

Current Limitations: The quantum components use small dimensions (e.g., 4D vectors with 2 qubits) for simulation purposes. Scaling to real-world LLMs (e.g., 768 dimensions) would require advanced quantum hardware.

 Purpose: This is an educational and experimental project, not a production-ready solution. Quantum acceleration of LLMs is still an emerging field!


This README should make the hybrid code approachable and useful for anyone interested in quantum machine learning. It’s a solid foundation, and with contributions, it could grow even better!
