# hybrIQ
HybrIQ implements a hybrid classical-quantum approach for training and inference of a large language model (LLM) like GPT-2. It combines PyTorch for classical computations with Qiskit for quantum computations, focusing on matrix operations that could potentially be accelerated on a quantum computer.
